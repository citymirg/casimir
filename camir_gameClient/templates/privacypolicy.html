    The non-personal information collected includes demographic information such as gender and age,
    geo-location information such as your country and city, information about your computer such as

    game play statistics such as scores and achievements, user rankings and time spent playing our games.

Especially your demographic and location information helps us understand how
different groups of people perceive music similarity.

and continue to use your non-personal information in
de-identified form for purposes of research.

 such as musical genres related to your music likes.

    information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or

    comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate,
    or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities;</p>
